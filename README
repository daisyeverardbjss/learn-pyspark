# Overview

This is a tutorial to try using the basics of pyspark to read a csv file into a dataframe and clean the data.

There are 2 options to set up this project. It can either be run locally or run on a databricks account

# Local Setup

THIS DOESN'T WORK YET, PLEASE USE DATABRICKS VERSION

asdf
poetry
python version = 3.13.1t

run `poetry init`
With the terminal open in this project, run `poetry install --no-root` to install all the depencies in the pyproject.toml file

use 'poetry run python task1.py' to run the file
If you run the command from the learn-pyspark directory, you will need to add the full filepath `Local/Exercise1/task1.py`

# Databricks setup

You may also run this lab by creating a databricks community edition account and using the notebooks provided in the `Databricks` directory. More detailed instructions can be found in the README there
