Reading in a csv

Challenges:

- Read in the CSV (link to docs, or maybe have this already done)
- Remove whitespace from strings.
- Correct inconsistent capitalizations (e.g., product names or cities)
- Handle invalid or impossible values (e.g., Evan's age of 790)
- Remove special characters or convert formats (e.g., Â£ in price column)
- Handle missing values
- split out names into first and last names
- duplicate rows (would need to add timestamps)

Anomaly Detection Challenges:

- Find entries with out-of-range values (e.g., age > 120 or price < 0)
- Detect duplicates (e.g., rows with the same data except for minor differences in formatting)
- Find mismatched types (e.g., numerical columns with text like "NA")
